# Letter to our Competition Hosts

Dear SECME Educators and Competition Hosts:
The SECME National Office is excited to welcome you to the 2022-2023 SECME Competition year. This year’s competition theme is “Based on School or ISL mascot or school motto.” This packet contains information for the SECME National Student Engineering Design Competition Finals, referred to as “Guidelines.” Due to the continuation of the public health crisis, the 2023 Competition will be virtual, and the content in this year’s Guidelines reflects a virtual National Competition. 
However, we are working with our schools, school districts, and member universities to ascertain the feasibility of a live, in-person National Competition. The SECME National Office will announce the determination on or before Monday, January 30, 2022. An addendum to these Guidelines will be prepared, disseminated, and posted on our website if the competition moves to a live, in-person format.
To our SECME competition hosts, in addition to hosting your SECME competition, in years past, many of you have provided technical assistance to schools and districts by way of SECME workshops for teachers to learn basic and necessary SECME competition skills to assist SECME students. The ability to provide these services continues to reside in this evolving new atmosphere. The SECME National Office is preparing to support by developing complementary competition training videos for all 2022-2023 registered schools.
To make this year’s competition fun and challenging, we added new engineering and artistic twists and turns to stir our future scientists’, engineers’, technologists,’ and mathematicians’ minds. Activities, deadlines, and SECME competitions at the local, state, district, and regional levels are at the discretion of the SECME Member University or Competition Host. We encourage participation at all levels and divisions (elementary, middle, and high school).
Thank you for your partnership and commitment to equity and excellence in STEM education. Have a wonderful and safe school year!

Sincerely,
Dr. Julaunica Tigner
Educational Outreach Manager

We welcome any corrections or any suggestions for improvement to our Guidelines. The feedback and comments we receive via email or telephone calls have supported the preparation of our annual guidelines. To provide feedback, please email julaunicatigner@ufl.edu

All SECME competitions:

* Are for both individual SECME students and SECME student teams.

* All competition hosts should communicate with their SECME participating schools and ISLs about their local arrangements.

*	All team competitions may have **one, two, or three students** on the team.
