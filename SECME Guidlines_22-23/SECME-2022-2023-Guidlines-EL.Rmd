# Letter to our Competition Hosts

Dear SECME Educators and Competition Hosts:

The SECME National Office is excited to welcome you to the 2022-2023 SECME Competition year. This year’s competition theme is based on “School or ISL mascot or school motto.” This packet contains information for the SECME National Student Engineering Design Competition Finals, referred to as “Guidelines.” Due to the continuation of the public health crisis, the 2023 Competition will be virtual, and the content in this year’s Guidelines reflects a virtual National Competition.

However, we are working with our schools, school districts, and member universities to ascertain the feasibility of a live, in-person National Competition. The SECME National Office will announce the determination on or before Monday, January 30, 2023. An addendum to these Guidelines will be prepared, disseminated, and posted on our website if the competition moves to a live, in-person format.

To our SECME competition hosts, in addition to hosting your SECME competition, in years past, many of you have provided technical assistance to schools and districts by way of SECME workshops for teachers to learn basic and necessary SECME competition skills to assist SECME students. The ability to provide these services continues to reside in this evolving new atmosphere. The SECME National Office is preparing to support by developing complementary competition training videos for all 2022-2023 registered schools.

To make this year’s competition fun and challenging, we added new engineering and artistic twists and turns to stir our future scientists’, engineers’, technologists,’ and mathematicians’ minds. Activities, deadlines, and SECME competitions at the local, state, district, and regional levels are at the discretion of the SECME Member University or Competition Host. We encourage participation at all levels and divisions (elementary, middle, and high school).

Thank you for your partnership and commitment to equity and excellence in STEM education. Have a wonderful and safe school year!

Sincerely,
Dr. Julaunica Tigner
Educational Outreach Manager

We welcome any corrections or any suggestions for improvement to our Guidelines. The feedback and comments we receive via email or telephone calls have supported the preparation of our annual guidelines. To provide feedback, please email julaunicatigner@ufl.edu

# Competition Guidelines

## Mouse Trap Car (MTC)

<center>
![](/Users/kristadulany/Documents/GitHub/SECME/SECME Guidlines_22-23/images/MTC_1.png){width=75%}
</center>

### All Divisions - Construction and Operation

Any team not adhering to the construction and operation guidelines will not be eligible to place.

#### Construction and Design Requirements

1.	**A standard mousetrap** with dimensions of: length of 9.8 cm, width of 4.5 cm, and weight about 25 grams, **MUST** be used to construct the mousetrap car. **NO PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, MECHANICAL, OR THERMAL TREATMENT OF THE MOUSETRAP IS PERMITTED.**

2.	Standard mousetraps with **ONE SPRING are ALLOWED**.

3.	The components of the mousetrap are a **wooden base. The other parts are mounted on the base: spring, bail, locking lever, and bait hook**. See [Standard Mousetrap Diagram].

4.	The mousetrap’s “single” spring must be the sole source of power. You may **NOT** provide extra power to your car by using rubber bands, CO2 boosters, rollback wheels/gears, or other agents or elements.

5.	In the car’s design and construction, the original mousetrap spring and wood base **MUST** remain intact. These two components may **NOT** be cut or altered in any way — mechanically, physically, chemically, or thermally. Only the locking lever and bait holder (and the staples that hold them on) may be removed from the base if desired. Teams may straighten the bail from its original bent configuration. It must remain a part of the completed car. 

6.	The spring must be visible and accessible to the judges for inspection.

7.	The mousetrap car must have a **minimum of three wheels** and can be as long or short as desired if it meets **requirement #5** above.

8.	Mousetrap cars are tested on a smooth flat surface. Distance will be measured from the front of the front wheel(s) at the starting point to the front of the front wheel(s) at the stopping point of travel, utilizing a straight line to connect the two points *(total displacement, not the path traveled)*.

9.	There will be two runs for each car. The best run is used for the final scoring of the mousetrap car’s performance. 

10.	The mousetrap car should reflect this year’s efforts by your SECME student teams. During SECME Competition, **ONLY** the SECME students on the same SECME student team can adjust or make alterations to their mousetrap car.

    a.	If anyone other than the student teams is seen adjusting the mousetrap car, or         there is evidence, the team will be disqualified and unable to compete.
    
    b.	This includes but is not limited to SECME Coordinators/Coaches, Parents, etc.

11.	Evidence of plagiarism or re-submission of previous years’ reports will result in a zero score.

The design requirement of this year’s SECME engineering design competition is for the SECME student team to design and build a vehicle solely powered by a single spring mousetrap with a maximum budget of $2.50 that can swiftly transport (or carry) a tennis ball with approximate weights and diameters of 57.7 grams and 66.9 mm (.64 inches).

**The mousetrap car**

*	Needs to carry a tennis ball with a weight of approximately 57.7 grams and a diameter of about 66.9 mm (.64 inches)

*	May NOT have glue, tape, or anything to affix the tennis ball to the mousetrap car

*	May NOT wedge the tennis ball between the bait hook and the spring

*	Should be designed to allow for the purposeful removal of the tennis ball with minimal effort so that the Judge can examine it

*	Should transport the tennis ball (without losing it for the entire run)

*	Should not exceed a budget of $2.50 in building materials (maximum budget)

Original receipts for all materials purchased must be included* (scanned) AND recorded on the SECME Mousetrap Car Material List. 
* *If receipts are unavailable for new (not recycled) items, a link to the purchase website is sufficient to confirm the item cost.*

*	Do NOT include the cost of the basic mousetrap in your materials list

*	If using recycled materials, documentation must show how these items were obtained

*	Recycled materials are not included in the $2.50 maximum budget

**The tennis ball must remain in the mousetrap vehicle for the entire run of the mousetrap car to receive a qualifying score. A run is disqualified if the tennis ball falls out of the car.** If the tennis ball is dislodged due to a collision with an obstacle, the run is not disqualified. The run distance is measured to the point of collision - the front of the front wheel(s) at the starting point to the front of the front wheel(s) at the stopping point or the point of collision.

**A standard-size tennis ball with a diameter of 66.9 mm (.64”) and 40 g will be given to the SECME student teams on the day of competition before their run at the SECME National Student Competition Finals.**

~The Mousetrap Car Materials List is required for the Technical Report Appendix for middle/high school teams and the Written Report for elementary school teams. If the Materials List is NOT submitted, the Cost (C) for the team’s score is double the highest cost (C~H~) in the competition formula.

#### Measurement of L, the Mouse Car’s Longest Dimension
The length L is the longest dimension in the x, y, or z-axis. In other words, it could be the length, width, or height of the completed mousetrap car, which is the longest dimension.

<center>
![](/Users/kristadulany/Documents/GitHub/SECME/SECME Guidlines_22-23/images/MTC2.jpg){width=75%}
</center>

The mousetrap car’s **length L is the longest dimension in the car’s x, y, or z-axis** while the car is resting with the spring unwound. In other words, it could be the length, width, or height of the completed mousetrap car, which is the longest dimension. If the bail has been straightened and protrudes past the front or rear of the car, the measurement is taken from the end of the bail to the other end of the car. 
**L (for this example) = 16.4 cm**

</center>

$\color{red}{\text{NOTE: The red parts may be removed from the car.}}$

### Elementary School Division - Construction and Operation

The MTC Engineering Design Competition, Elementary School Division requires participation in these two areas:

1.	Performance Run of the Mousetrap Car
2.	Written Report on Mousetrap Car

#### In-Person Event - Calculation of Mousetrap Car Score

The performance score for the Mousetrap car run is calculated using the following equation:

<center>
$P =\frac{D}{L} × \frac{D}{T} × \frac{C_H}{C}$
</center>

Where:
D is the distance the mousetrap car travels measured in centimeters (cm).

L is the longest length of the completed mousetrap car from any orientation on the x, y, and z-axis measured in centimeters (cm).

T is time measured from when the mousetrap car is released until the car has stopped, measured in seconds (s). 

C^+^ is the cost of the construction of the completed mousetrap car (based on the team’s MTC Materials List).*

C~H~ is a constant 2.5 (the highest possible cost). Therefore, C~H~=$2.50 in the equation.

P is the mousetrap car performance run score.

<center>
$F = \frac{P}{P_H} ×100%$
</center>

where:

P~H~ is the highest performance mousetrap car score on the day of the SECME Competition. 

F is the final performance score to be combined with the score from the Written Report.

Distance is measured from the front of the front wheel(s) at the starting point to the front of the front wheel(s) at the stopping point of travel, utilizing a straight line to connect the two points.

<mark> The Mousetrap Car **MUST travel a MINIMUM distance of 2 m (200 cm)** to qualify for the competition. </mark>

Suppose the mousetrap car stops due to hitting an object or wall. The distance is measured from the starting point to the point of impact.

<small> *If the MTC Materials List is NOT submitted, the Cost (C) for the team’s score is calculated as double the highest cost (C~H~) in the competition formula.*</small>

<small> *If the value of C is $0.00 (meaning that except for the mousetrap, your car is built entirely with recycled materials), then use $0.01 (one penny) for the value of C. Therefore, C=0.01 in the equation.*</small>


##### Example Calculation

<center>
$C=0.01$ 

$C_H=2.50$ 

C, C~H~ are in USD ($) amounts

$D=950 cm$ 

$T=9.50 s$

$P=\frac{D}{L}×\frac{D}{T}×\frac{C_H}{C}=\frac{950cm}{30cm}×\frac{950cm}{9.50s}×\frac{(2.50)}{(0.01)}=7,916,667$
</center>

The Final Score is based on the following two criteria*:
	Performance Score	50%
	Written Report		50%

#### Virtual Event - Calculation of Mousetrap Car Score

Calculate the score when there is no physical competition - car run

<center>
$P=\frac{D}{L}×\frac{D}{T}×\frac{C_H}{C}$
</center>

For the virtual competition in the elementary school division, to calculate the performance score for your Mousetrap car run, use the following values:

<center>
$D=200 cm$ 

$t=60 s$
</center>

The Final Score is based on the following two criteria*:
	Performance Score	50%
	Written Report		50%
*NOTE: The maximum elementary division mousetrap car final score is 100 pts.

### Elementary School Division - Construction and Operation

#### In-Person Event - Calculation of Water Bottle Score 

<center><mark>**NOTE: Each entry must pass a visual inspection and height requirement to be eligible to compete. Entries that fail inspection are given ONE opportunity to make modifications to pass inspection before the beginning of the water bottle rocket competition.**</mark></center>

An overall winner is determined by the following criteria (based on 100 pts):
* Final Hang Time of Rocket	40 %
* Patch Design			25 %
* Written Report			35 %

**Final Hangtime Score Calculation**

<center> $Final Hangtime Score=\frac{Hangtime}{Max Hangtime}x100%$ </center>

**Hangtime** is the time from when the rocket leaves the launch pad until it (or any part of it) reaches the ground or strikes an object. This measurement will be taken using a stopwatch by two or three (2-3) qualified judges. The average of the judges’ times will be used as the team’s hangtime.

**Max Hangtime** is the maximum hang time recorded during the SECME Competition.

The contest’s objective is for each SECME student team to launch a rocket-propelled by water and air and for it to stay aloft for the maximum amount of time (measured in seconds). The launch angle, which can be adjusted from approximately **90 degrees (90^o^)**, will be kept the **SAME** for all rockets launching during a particular competition. Each rocket will be launched using **12 oz water** at **70 psi of air pressure**.

NOTE: The maximum final elementary Water Bottle Rocketry score is 100 pts.

#### Virtual Event - Calculation of Water Bottle Rocket Score
There is no hangtime performance

The winner will be judged on the following criteria: (based on 100 pts):
* Patch Design			25 %
* The Art of Engineering		25%
* Written Report			50 %

The written report must include calculation exercises:

**Example Explanation of Patch**

The propelled rocket represents the school system, supported by educators and students, following a path towards excellence. The radiant five 8-point stars symbolize the enrichment of Science, Engineering, Communication, and Mathematics, whereas the seven 4-point stars represent the seven Universities that founded SECME. The three distinct contrails STEMing behind the rocket symbolize the support offered by SECME, Universities, and Industry partners. The ring before the rocket depicts a student’s path through the SECME program, returning full circle to support the program’s efforts. As we have entered the new millennium, the sun over the horizon symbolizes the induction of the new Water bottle rocket Design Competition into the SECME Programs. Accuracy, the contest’s focus, represents the target created by the outer ring, deep space, and the earth. The border is supported on the left and right by the water and compressed air symbols; the fluids used to propel the rockets. 


## The Art of Engineering (AOE)

### The Art of Engineering Showcase

What is the Art of Engineering (AOE)? AOE is an opportunity for SECME student teams to showcase and discuss the design approach used for their car/rocket/robot. **The AOE competition only takes place at National Competition Finals**.

The AOE Video Presentation replaces the live, in-person AOE Showcase.

1.	This video presentation showcases the ART in the SECME student team engineering design of their car/rocket/robot.

2.	Each SECME student team will submit a five to seven-minute video on their car/rocket/robot from a creative, innovative, and artistic perspective.

There are tons of information at your fingertips – Enjoy! Don’t forget to take good notes! You’re almost ready to start your essay!


#### Phase 4: Essay

Topic 1: How has participation in SECME helped me to discover my STEM dream job?

You’ve done a lot of work. Time to put it all together and use your new knowledge to persuade the SECME Essay Competition judges that you have figured out your destination!

In Phase 4, you will need to be diligent. You’ve gathered a good bit of research, and now you need to decide how you can use it. The competition judges want you to help them understand:

1. What STEMulates your mind in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics?

2. What has your research shown you? Is it possible you have found the career you want to pursue? 

3. What has your research shown you? Is it possible you have found the university or college you will attend? 

Don’t make the mistake of thinking that this phase of your journey will be easy. You will want to take your time and write several drafts before submitting your work to your SECME Coordinator.

It’s ok to ask for help after you write your drafts. However, YOU need to ensure that your essay is in YOUR words! The judges want to feel like YOU are talking to them, not a parent, teacher, or friend…YOU! 

Others can ensure that your final copy is correct, without errors, but they should NOT express your feelings for you – they are YOUR ideas and reactions to what you have discovered during your exploration. And don’t forget to let the judges know if you were surprised by any information you found in your research – they would be interested to learn that your journey was a success. A successful personal exploration will be when you learn something about yourself – about what gets you excited and ready to go for your goals. Be sure to share something that you did NOT know before you started!!

So, it’s time to think, write, re-write, edit, and then move on to Phase 5!

#### Phase 5: Vision Board

Topic 1: How has participation in SECME helped me to discover my STEM dream job?

This vision board is a visualization of your future STEM career. Using art, create a vision board that depicts your future career path and expresses your hopes and dreams in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.

## VEX V5/VEX IQ Robotics Judging

### Engineering Notebook Judge’s Evaluation Instructions

One of the VEX V5/VEX IQ Robotics Competition’s main missions is to help SECME student teams acquire real-world life skills to benefit them in their academic and professional future. The Engineering Notebook is a way for student teams to document the engineering design process during the VEX V5/VEX IQ Robotics Competition. The engineering notebook gives student teams the practice of essential life skills, including project management, time management, brainstorming, and teamwork. The engineering notebook reflects the documentation of the student team’s design decisions and efforts in creating a novel and innovative competitive robot. SECME student teams should start their engineering notebooks early and update them often and daily. Write handwritten notes and documentation neatly and clearly for judges to read without difficulty. 

Engineering is an iterative process requiring students to recognize and define a problem, brainstorm, and work through various stages of the design process, test their designs, improve their designs, and continue the process until a solution has been produced. During this process, students will come across obstacles, encounter successes and failures, and learn many lessons. It is this process that students should document in their Engineering Notebook. 

The engineering notebook is an opportunity to document everything a SECME student team does and serve as a historical guide of lessons learned and best practices that can benefit the SECME student team in future years. SECME students may document any number of things in their engineering notebooks. For example, team meeting notes, design concepts and sketches, pictures, notes from competitions, biographies of the members of their team (students, teachers, Coordinators, and mentors), observations and thoughts of team members throughout the season, team organization practices, and any other notes that a team finds useful.

7. How does my SECME team determine the cost of 3D printing? 

    For 3D printing, the SECME student team evaluates the cost of the material used to make the part for their vehicle. 

    Example: Polylactic acid (PLA) pellets can be purchased for the price of $10.00 per 1 kg. If the SECME student team only used 1 g, the following calculation they would need to do to determine the cost of their 3D component:

    <center>
$\frac{10.00}{1 kg}×1 g×\frac{1 kg}{1000 g}=0.01$
    Cost = $0.01
    </center>

    The following is a link to how much 3D materials will cost in 2020:
    
    https://all3dp.com/2/how-much-do-3d-printer-materials-cost/

8. How does my SECME team log their purchases on their material list?

    Example: Balloons were purchased for $10.99 for 100 balloons. If the SECME student team only used two balloons, the following will be the calculation they would need to do to determine the cost:
    
    <center>
    $\frac{10.99}{100 ballons}×2 balloons=0.22$ 

    $0.22 for two balloons
    </center>
